##Workflow

Pia is a Chrome extension that works by injecting Javascript into the current webpage. Invoking Pia either through the address bar icon or the keyboard shortcut (Alt + P) overlays the Pia interface in the top right corner of the webpage. Pressing spacebar or clicking on the microphone then initiates voice recording, and pressing spacebar or clicking the icon once again completes voice recognition.

##Known Issues

Pia has a few issues that need to be fixed before we can push it to the Chrome Store. It started off as a project at the [PennApps Spring 2014](http://2014s.pennapps.com/ "PennApps Spring 2014") hackathon, and we now hope to finish it as an open-source project with your help.

- Voice recording should start as soon as Pia is called
